This program aims at picking a random winner from a list of participants. 

BUGS: 
Current test shows that the method readData() in the WinnerPicker.java may sometimes throw IOException due to the mistake in the file path. 
If you want to use this program, you should figure out the file path of Names.csv and modify the second line of the readData() method.
